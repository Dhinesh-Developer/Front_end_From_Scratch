    Main articles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and Markup language
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the modern standard for displaying and structuring web content across the internet.[6] HTML defines what elements will be displayed on a website, and how they will be arranged. All major web browsers are designed to interpret HTML, and most modern websites serve HTML to the user.[7] Hypertext is text displayed on a computer with references to other text, these references (or links,) are termed "hyperlinks." When an internet user interacts with a hyperlinked item, the website serves the user the linked data. This data can be another HTML web-page, JavaScript, or anything else.

<h2 id="b">Backend</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend">Backend</a> engineering, the terms frontend and backend (sometimes written as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the client–server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.</p>
